# Shell-Tools
### Just some simple shell tools

## Folder Structure
# Ubuntu/Debian
- The `<home>/.config/shell-tools` directory holds miscellaneous configuration files for my tools.
- Inside `<home>/.config/shell-tools/mysql`, you'll find the necessary MySQL configurations.
- The `/mysql` directory contains my MySQL dumper and importer scripts, where each table has its own gzip-compressed SQL file.
